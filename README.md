# DSA Practice

Welcome to my **DSA Practice** repository! This repo is a collection of my daily Data Structures and Algorithms practice, solving problems across various platforms and using different techniques. The main goal is to improve problem-solving skills, coding efficiency, and mastery over core concepts in DSA.

---

## üìö Overview

This repository contains solutions for problems across different topics in Data Structures and Algorithms. These are primarily implemented in [language you're using, e.g., C++, Java, Python, etc.] and span topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.

Feel free to explore the solutions, suggest optimizations, or provide feedback!

---

## üî• Topics Covered

The repository is organized into folders by topic:

- **Arrays & Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Recursion**
- **Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graphs**
- **Sorting & Searching**
- **Hashing**
- **Backtracking**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Structure

Each folder contains solutions to problems along with explanations, where necessary. Every solution includes:

- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem.
- **Solution**: Code implementation.
- **Time Complexity**: Time complexity analysis for the solution.
- **Space Complexity**: Space complexity analysis for the solution.

## üåü Problem Sources

The problems I practice come from various platforms like:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)

Feel free to try them yourself!

## üöÄ Goals

- Solve at least **1 DSA problem every day**.
- Cover all major DSA topics.
- Track progress over time and improve performance.
